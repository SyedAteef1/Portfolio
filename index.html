                <p>During my first year of diploma studies, I was highly interested in the creation and functionality of websites. I eagerly searched for someone to teach me, not realizing that it was ultimately my responsibility to learn what I desired. As a result, I began studying HTML on my own. The memory of creating my first web page still brings me joy, which I shared with my mother who also became ecstatic upon learning about this accomplishment. From there, I continued to expand my knowledge and skills in HTML and CSS by mastering all the fundamental concepts.
                <br>Throughout my learning journey, I have gained proficiency in several programming languages including C, Java, Python, SQL, and have also grasped the fundamentals of JavaScript.</p>

            <p style="letter-spacing:5px; margin-top: 25px;">I was the lead in a team that worked on a project called the Electricity Bill Generator. This project utilized Java as the frontend and SQL (Structured Query Language) as the backend. I contributed approximately 90% of the work to this project.</p>

            <div id="lastconp">
            <p>Besides academics and studies, I found myself captivated by esports (electronic sports) at a certain point. It piqued my interest and I discovered that I had a natural talent for it. However, my primary challenge was the lack of a suitable device, compounded by my family's financial circumstances. This compelled me to think creatively and embark on a journey of learning about mobile devices. I soon grasped the significance of the operating system, which serves as the control center for all tasks and greatly impacts performance. This prompted me to delve into the intricacies of operating systems and even experiment with different kernels. I would frequently change my mobile's operating system on a weekly basis, exploring the possibilities. Eventually, I came to the realization that without a proper team, I couldn't fully pursue esports. Consequently, I made the difficult decision to cease playing games. Nonetheless, this experience proved to be a valuable learning opportunity, enriching my knowledge in various domains.</p>
