                <p>During my first year of diploma studies, I was highly interested in the creation and functionality of websites. I eagerly searched for someone to teach me, not realizing that it was ultimately my responsibility to learn what I desired. As a result, I began studying HTML on my own. The memory of creating my first web page still brings me joy, which I shared with my mother who also became ecstatic upon learning about this accomplishment. From there, I continued to expand my knowledge and skills in HTML and CSS by mastering all the fundamental concepts.
                <br>Throughout my learning journey, I have gained proficiency in several programming languages including C, Java, Python, SQL, and have also grasped the fundamentals of JavaScript.</p>
