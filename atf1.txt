Besides academics and studies, I found myself captivated by esports (electronic sports) at a certain point. It piqued my interest and I discovered that I had a natural talent for it. However, my primary challenge was the lack of a suitable device, compounded by my family's financial circumstances. This compelled me to think creatively and embark on a journey of learning about mobile devices. I soon grasped the significance of the operating system, which serves as the control center for all tasks and greatly impacts performance. This prompted me to delve into the intricacies of operating systems and even experiment with different kernels. I would frequently change my mobile's operating system on a weekly basis, exploring the possibilities. Eventually, I came to the realization that without a proper team, I couldn't fully pursue esports. Consequently, I made the difficult decision to cease playing games. Nonetheless, this experience proved to be a valuable learning opportunity, enriching my knowledge in various domains.
